# ttLib

This repository contains several classes and functions that have been used in most of the KeyWorks Software projects since the company was formed in 1998. As such, it will appear as a sub-module in most repositories owned by KeyWorksRW.

There are two versions of the library: ttLibwin.lib (**winsrc/**) that can only be used on Windows, and ttLib.lib (**src/**) which is cross platform.

For information on how to build the project, see [Building](BUILD.md).

If you wish to contribute to the project, please refer to the [Contributing](CONTRIBUTING.md) documentation.
