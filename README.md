# ttLib

This repository contains several classes and functions that have been used in most of the KeyWorks Software projects since the company was formed in 1998. As such, it will appear as a sub-module in most repositories owned by **KeyWorks Software**.

The source code for the library is split into two primary directories. The **src/** directory contains code that should work on any platform. The **src/winsrc/** directory contains code that can only be used when compiling for Windows.

For information on how to build the project, see [Building](BUILD.md).

If you wish to contribute to the project, please refer to the [Contributing](CONTRIBUTING.md) documentation.
