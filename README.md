# ttLib

This repository contains several classes and functions that have been used in most of the KeyWorks Software projects since the company was formed in 1998. As such, it will appear as a sub-module in most repositories owned by KeyWorksRW.

Currently, **ttLib** is only being tested on Windows (version 7 and up). Cross-platform support is planned, but not scheduled until sometime in 2020.

For information on how to build the project, see [Building](BUILD.md).

If you wish to contribute to the project, please refer to the [Contributing](CONTRIBUTING.md) documentation.
